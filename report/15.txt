⎈ Hidden in layers

Welcome

⎈ Hidden in layers
🙌 Overview
Most of the container images download and used on the internet are created by someone else.
If we don't know how they get created (which means if we don't have Dockerfile ) then I think
we might be in trouble sometimes. In this scenario, we can see how to analyze the docker
container image layers by using the built-in utilities and also some popular open-source utilities
like dive to understand the container image layers.

By the end of the scenario, we will understand and learn the following
1. How to explore, introspect and analyze docker container images
2. Using open source tools like dive to perform container image analysis
3. Able to work with standard command-line utilities

⚡️ The story
Sensitive information disclosure is one of the most common vulnerabilities existing in the wild.
Mishandling of passwords, private keys, tokens, etc in the containerization world is easy. Here
in this scenario, we will analyze and identify one of such mishandled bad practices that leads to
sensitive information disclosure.

INFO

To get started with the scenario, run the following command and explore the
hidden-layers job
kubectl get jobs

🎯 Goal
TIP

Find the k8s_goat_flag flag value in one of the hidden layers of the container, then you
have completed this scenario.

🎉 Solution & Walkthrough
INFO

Try exploring all files, environment variables, etc in the running container. Next, try to
analyze the image used above with different tools to find exposed sensitive information.

Docker CLI is an amazing tool with lots of features, let's start with inspecting the image

docker inspect madhuakula/k8s-goat-hidden-in-layers

We can observe the cmd section in the above output. It shows the default command
executed by this image on startup. Though this shows some interesting information, it's
not good enough for us
Maybe it would be more helpful for us if we get to know how this image is built from
scratch. For that, we need to analyze the Dockerfile of the image. If you have
Dockerfile , it's good. If not, there are a few ways to analyze it

🎲 Method 1
We can explore each layer by using the default docker history command

docker history --no-trunc madhuakula/k8s-goat-hidden-in-layers

🎲 Method 2
We can use the dfimage to generate a Dockerfile of any given image. First, we can set up
that and perform it by running the following commands

alias dfimage="docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --rm
alpine/dfimage"

dfimage -sV=1.36 madhuakula/k8s-goat-hidden-in-layers

🎲 Method 3
dive is an amazing tool that helps with analyzing each layer of an image

NOTE

From all the above analyses, we can see some significant changes in these two files,
/root/contributions.txt , /root/secret.txt . The above methods cannot help us to

read the contents of these files. Let's see if we can find these files in the running
container.

We can't see /root/secret.txt as it is deleted from the next layers. We can recover the
/root/secret.txt by leveraging the docker built-in command to export the docker image

as a tar file

docker save madhuakula/k8s-goat-hidden-in-layers -o hidden-in-layers.tar

Now we have the artifact and we can extract the tar file to explore the layers

tar -xvf hidden-in-layers.tar

TIP

We can see each layer getting exported as a single tar file. We have 3 layers in this image,
so we have 3 tar files. Since we have only 3 layers, it's easy to extract all of them and
check the contents but that's not the conventional approach. What if we have hundreds
of layers?

Let's review the dive output again. In the below image, we saw a new file,
/root/secret.txt is being created

Observe the Id of that layer,
da73da4359e9edb793ee5472ae3538be8aec57c27efff7dae8873566c865533f . Since, we have
/root/secret.txt created in this layer, let's extract the tar file of this layer first

cd da73da4359e9edb793ee5472ae3538be8aec57c27efff7dae8873566c865533f

tar -xvf layer.tar

cat root/secret.txt

Hooray 🥳 , now we found Kubernetes Goat flag
