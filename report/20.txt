🚀 Scenarios

⎈ Secure Network Boundaries using NSP

Welcome

⎈ Secure Network Boundaries
using NSP
🙌 Overview
As you have seen in some of the scenarios and in general Kubernetes comes with a flat
networking schema. This means if you wanted to create network boundaries, you will need to
create something called a Network Policy with the help of CNI. In this scenario, we will be
looking at a simple use case of how you can create a Network Policy to restrict traffic and
create network security boundaries between Kubernetes resources.

By the end of the scenario, you will understand and learn the following:
1. You will learn to work with Network Policies in Kubernetes Cluster
2. Understand and work with basic Kubernetes kubectl commands and interact with pods &
services
3. Creating and destroying Kubernetes resources and restricting the traffic using NSPs

⚡️ The story

This scenario is to deploy a simple Network Security Policy for Kubernetes resources to create
security boundaries.

INFO

To get started with this scenario, please ensure you are using a networking solution that
supports NetworkPolicy

🎯 Goal
TIP

Create a Network Policy to drop the access to the website service to complete this
scenario.

🎉 Solution & Walkthrough
🎲 Method 1
NOTE

Refer to https://github.com/ahmetb/kubernetes-network-policy-recipes for more recipes
and a detailed explanation of Network Security Policies with examples and details.

Let's run the Nginx container with app=website labels and expose it via port 80

kubectl run --image=nginx website --labels app=website --expose --port 80

Now, let's run a temporary pod to make a simple HTTP request to the website service

kubectl run --rm -it --image=alpine temp -- sh

Let's make a simple HTTP request using wget to the website service

wget -qO- http://website

So far it works perfectly fine. Now let's create a Network Policy and apply it to the
Kubernetes cluster to block/deny any requests.
website-deny.yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
name: website-deny
spec:
podSelector:
matchLabels:
app: website
ingress: []

Let's deploy this NSP policy to the cluster by running the following command:

kubectl apply -f website-deny.yaml

Now, let's retry a HTTP request to our website service

kubectl run --rm -it --image=alpine temp -- sh

Let's run the wget query to access the website

wget -qO- --timeout=2 http://website

As you can see the Network Policy is dropping the traffic and you are not able to access
the website now.
You can remove all the applied resources and clean up by running the following commands

kubectl delete pod website
kubectl delete service website
kubectl delete networkpolicy website-deny

Hooray 🥳 , now you have successfully learned how to implement and work with Network
Policies in Kubernetes Clusters!
