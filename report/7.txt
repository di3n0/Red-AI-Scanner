⎈ Attacking private registry

Welcome

⎈ Attacking private registry
🙌 Overview
In this scenario, we will see one of the misconfigurations of Docker container private registries
and how we can obtain and gain access to the images and their content. There was a popular
hack around this in the early days of containers where vine (Twitter acquired now) got hacked
and the entire source code of the product was leaked due to this simple misconfiguration.
Also, we see a ton of similar cases even today but with authenticated registries as well and
misconfigured permissions and privileges.

By the end of the scenario, we will understand and learn the following
1. How to interact with Docker container registry API
2. Able to introspect the container registry API, container images, and manifests
3. Understand how container metadata gets stored and interacts with the layers

⚡️ The story
A container registry is a place where all the container images get pushed. Most of the time
each organization has its own private registry. Also sometimes it ends up misconfigured,
public/open. On the other hand, developers assume that their internal private registry is only

for internal and end up storing all the sensitive information inside the container images. Let's
see what we can find here.

INFO

To get started with the scenario, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:1235

🎯 Goal
TIP

To complete this scenario you need to obtain the k8s-goat-FLAG flag value in the private
registry images.

✨ Found the container image?

🎉 Solution & Walkthrough
🎲 Method

NOTE

As this is an intentionally vulnerable design, we directly provided the endpoint. In the real
world, you have to do some recon or even need to exploit the authenticated registries by
a combination of other vulnerabilities chains.

Based on the scenario and information, we can identify that it's possible docker container
private registry
After reading some documentation and googling, here are the simple API endpoint
queries for talking to the container registry
To query the registry API v2

curl http://127.0.0.1:1235/v2/

The following endpoint is to query the catalog information, which returns all the details of
images available in the container registry

curl http://127.0.0.1:1235/v2/_catalog

We can get more information about the specific image using the image name with a tag
with a manifest endpoint

curl http://127.0.0.1:1235/v2/madhuakula/k8s-goat-users-repo/manifests/latest

Now we can see this container image has ENV variables that contain API key information,
so we can quickly grep that out

curl http://127.0.0.1:1235/v2/madhuakula/k8s-goat-users-repo/manifests/latest
| grep -i env

TIP

This can be taken a little further by using the docker client to download the images
locally and analyzing. Also in some cases, you can even push the image to the registry
based on the permissions and privileges.
Hooray 🥳 , now we can see that it contains Kubernetes Goat flag
