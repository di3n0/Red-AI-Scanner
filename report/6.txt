🚀 Scenarios

⎈ Kubernetes CIS benchmarks analysis

Welcome

⎈ Kubernetes CIS benchmarks
analysis
🙌 Overview
This scenario is very useful in performing Kubernetes security audits and assessments. Here we
will learn to run the popular CIS benchmark audit for the Kubernetes cluster and use the
results for the further exploitation or fixing of the misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. This is
very important and mandates if you are coming from an audit and compliance background in
the modern world of containers, Kubernetes, and cloud native ecosystems.

By the end of the scenario, we will understand and learn the following
1. You will learn to perform CIS benchmark audit for Kubernetes clusters
2. Working with jobs, Pods in Kubernetes, and other resources in the cluster
3. Gain visibility of the entire Kubernetes cluster security posture and understand the risks

⚡️ The story
This scenario is mainly to perform the Kubernetes CIS benchmarks analysis on top of
Kubernetes nodes and cluster resources to identify the possible security vulnerabilities.

To get started with this scenario you can either access the node and perform by following
kube-bench security or run the following command to deploy kube-bench as Kubernetes

job

INFO

To get started with the scenario, you can deploy the Kubernetes CIS benchmarks job
using the following commands
kubectl apply -f scenarios/kube-bench-security/node-job.yaml

kubectl apply -f scenarios/kube-bench-security/master-job.yaml

🎯 Goal
TIP

The goal of this scenario is to perform the Kubernetes CIS benchmark audit and obtain
the results from the audit.

Hints & Spoilers
✨ Not sure how to run the audit?

🎉 Solution & Walkthrough
🎲 Method 1
We can deploy the Kubernetes CIS benchmarks by running the following command

kubectl apply -f scenarios/kube-bench-security/node-job.yaml

Now we can obtain the list of jobs and associated pods information by running the
following command

kubectl get jobs

kubectl get pods

Once we have identified the pod, then we can get the audit results by running the
following command. Make sure to replace the pod name in the following command

kubectl logs -f kube-bench-node-xxxxx

Now based on the vulnerabilities you see from the Kubernetes CIS benchmarks, you can
proceed with further exploitation
Hooray 🥳 , now we can see that it returns the all security issues/misconfigurations from
the cluster
