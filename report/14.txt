Welcome

⎈ Hacker container preview
🙌 Overview #​
While performing and testing container or Kubernetes infrastructure, we always have to install
some common tools inside a container to perform further exploitation and later moved within
the cluster. So Hacker Container is a simple alpine-based docker container with commonly used
tools and utilities while performing security assessments for containerized and Kubernetes
cluster environments.

By the end of the scenario, we will understand and learn the following
1. How to work with hacker-container and explore multiple common security tools,
commands
2. Learn to use the hacker container for enumeration, exploitation, and post-exploitation

⚡️ The story

This scenario is just an exploration of the common security utilities inside the Kubernetes
Cluster environment. I think by this time you might have already used hacker-container
multiple times.

INFO

To get started with this scenario, run the hacker container using the following
command
kubectl run -it hacker-container --image=madhuakula/hacker-container -sh

🎯 Goal
TIP

If you successfully run the hacker container and explore the different tools and utilities
available, that pretty much helps you to achieve the goal of this scenario.

Hints & Spoilers

🎉 Solution & Walkthrough
🎲 Method 1
INFO

Hacker Container is a utility with a list of useful tools/commands while hacking
Kubernetes Clusters. So there is no limit to your exploration of Kubernetes environments.
Here we will see some of the most useful and powerful utilities

We can use a simple and powerful utility like amicontained to perform the container
introspection and get an overview of the system capabilities, etc.

amicontained

Performing Nikto scan against internal services using hacker-container

nikto.pl -host http://metadata-db

TIP

There are many other use cases. To get the maximum out of the hacker container, we can
use host privileges, volumes, processes, etc. Will be updated soon with more details.
Hooray 🥳 , now you have superpowers with you, let's go and hack!
