⎈ Popeye - A Kubernetes cluster sanitizer

Welcome

⎈ Popeye - A Kubernetes
cluster sanitizer
🙌 Overview
This scenario is useful in performing Kubernetes security audits and assessments. Here you will
learn how to run an open-source tool called Popeye for the Kubernetes cluster. You will also
use the results for the further exploitation or fixing of the misconfigurations and
vulnerabilities found. This is very important if you are coming from an audit and compliance
background in the modern world of containers, Kubernetes, and cloud native ecosystems.

By the end of the scenario, you will understand and learn the following:
1. You will learn to perform Kubernetes audit for Kubernetes clusters
2. Working with open source utilities to perform audits and investigations of the cluster
resources
3. Gain visibility of the entire Kubernetes cluster security posture and understand the risks

⚡️ The story

This scenario is mainly to perform the review of the Kubernetes Cluster by scanning the live
Kubernetes cluster and reporting potential issues with deployed resources and configurations.

INFO

To get started with this scenario you can run the following command to start the hackercontainer with cluster administrator privileges (as the tiller service account already has

that)

kubectl run -n kube-system --serviceaccount=tiller --rm --restart=Never it --image=madhuakula/hacker-container -- bash

🎯 Goal
TIP

The goal of this scenario is to perform the Kubernetes security audit and obtain the
results from the audit.

Hints & Spoilers
✨ Not sure how to run the audit?

🎉 Solution & Walkthrough
🎲 Method 1
INFO

Popeye is a utility that scans live Kubernetes clusters and reports potential issues with

deployed resources and configurations. It sanitizes your cluster based on what's deployed
and not what's sitting on the disk. Scanning your cluster helps detect misconfigurations
and helps you to ensure that best practices are in place, thus preventing future
headaches.

Here is a list of some of the available sanitizers
Node
Namespace
Pod
Service
ServiceAccount
Secrets
ConfigMap
Deployment
StatefulSet
DaemonSet
PersistentVolume
PersistentVolumeClaim
HorizontalPodAutoscaler
PodDisruptionBudget
ClusterRole
ClusterRoleBinding
Role
RoleBinding
Ingress
NetworkPolicy
PodSecurityPolicy

To get started with this scenario you can run the following command to start the hackercontainer with cluster administrator privileges (as the tiller service account already has

that)

kubectl run -n kube-system --serviceaccount=tiller --rm --restart=Never -it -image=madhuakula/hacker-container -- bash

Run the popeye in the cluster by using cluster-admin token privileges

popeye

Now based on the vulnerabilities you see from the Popeye, you can proceed with further
exploitation
Hooray 🥳 , now we can see that it returns the all security issues/misconfigurations from
the cluster
