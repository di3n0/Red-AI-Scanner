🚀 Scenarios

⎈ Gaining environment information

Welcome

⎈ Gaining environment
information
🙌 Overview
This is no different from the traditional workloads. Most of the compute instances while
running the applications store sensitive information like secrets, api_keys, etc. in the
environment variables. Similarly, in Kubernetes, most of the people store sensitive information
like Kubernetes Secrets and the Config values in the environment variables and if an attacker
can find application vulnerabilities like RCE(remote code execution) or command injection then
it's game over for that secret.

By the end of the scenario, we will understand and learn the following
1. How to explore the environment variables and analyze
2. Gaining access to sensitive information in the container

⚡️ The story
Each environment in Kubernetes will have a lot of information to share. Some of the key things
include secrets, API keys, configs, services, and a lot more. So let's go ahead and find the vault

key!

INFO

To get started with the scenario, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:1233

🎯 Goal
TIP

Get the k8s_goat_flag flag value then you have completed this scenario. This can be
found in multiple ways!

Hints & Spoilers
✨ Not sure where the environment variables get stored?

🎉 Solution & Walkthrough
🎲 Method 1
We can explore the container by running different commands and understand the system
much better. This is more like an exploration scenario to explore the container and
understand it better
We can get the container runtime information by running the below command

cat /proc/self/cgroup

We can get the information of the container host's information

cat /etc/hosts

We can get the mount information

mount

We can also look and explore the file system

ls -la /home/

We can access the environment variables, including Kubernetes secrets mounted and
service names, ports, etc.

printenv

Hooray 🥳 , now we can see that it contains the Kubernetes Goat flag which is mounted as
a Kubernetes secret inside the pod/container
