We can start with enumeration and reconnaissance to understand what services are running in the current instance and other networks based on the available information.

We can also query the current container/pod to see if any other services running by querying the different ports and addresses. Let's query the port in the same container with method .5000http://127.0.0.1:5000GETAs we can see, it's running some web service and returned the HTTP response as well. So now we have more data/information to further our attack towards more access within the Kubernetes network services.

Now we can see that there is an internal-only exposed service within the cluster called , let's a query and see if we can get any more useful information .metadata-dbhttp://metadata-dbAfter enumerating through the entire key values, finally we can see that there is a flag at endpoint.http://metadata-db/latest/secrets/kubernetes-goat
We can decode the returned/obtained base64 flag to see the information
echo -n "azhzLWdvYXQtY2E5MGVmODVkYjdhNWFlZjAxOThkMDJmYjBkZjljYWI=" | base64 -d

Scenario 3 decode base64
