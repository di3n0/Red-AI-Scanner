🚀 Scenarios

⎈ NodePort exposed services

Welcome

⎈ NodePort exposed services
🙌 Overview
In this scenario, we see another misconfiguration that may give attackers access to internal
services and non-exposed services. This is one of the simple misconfigurations made when
creating the Kubernetes services and also the cluster setup and configurations.

By the end of the scenario, we will understand and learn the following
1. How Kubernetes NodePort works, configuration, and the ranges
2. Performing the portscan and interacting with Kubernetes nodes

⚡️ The story
If any of the users exposed any service within the Kubernetes cluster with NodePort , this
means that the nodes where the Kubernetes clusters are running don't have any
firewall/network security enabled. We need to see some unauthenticated and unauthorized
services.

INFO

To get started with the scenario, run the following command and look for Kubernetes
nodes external IP addresses

kubectl get nodes -o wide

TIP

When Kubernetes creates a NodePort service, it allocates a port from a range specified in
the flags that are defined in your Kubernetes cluster configuration. (By default, these are
ports ranging from 30000-32767.)

🎯 Goal
TIP

If you can access the metadata-db service using the public IP address of the node with the
NodePort, then you can complete the scenario.

🎉 Solution & Walkthrough
🎲 Method 1
CAUTION

This vulnerability/attack varies depending on how the Kubernetes cluster has been
configured. If your Kubernetes cluster is configured with firewalling and blocking the
nodes exposed ports, then this scenario might not work for you but the concepts are the
same 😊
Get the list of Kubernetes nodes external IP addresses information by running the
following command

kubectl get nodes -o wide

TIP

Now, let's find out the open ports. In this case, you can use your traditional security
scanning utilities like nmap
Once we identified that there is a NodePort exposed, we can just verify by connecting and
accessing it

nc -zv EXTERNAL-IP-ADDRESS 30003

Hooray 🥳 , now we can see that we can access the internal services which are not
exposed to the world can be accessed and bypassed due to the NodePort configuration
